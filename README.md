# Context
Context is an annotation service to take content from the web and add annotations . Check out the main [Github repo here](https://github.com/EnshaednHiker/context) for a detailed tutorial on both the server and web client. 

## Server
The server at this time is currently hosted on Heroku. I used CircleCI for continuous integration testing. [Github repo for the server API for the context webclient.](https://github.com/EnshaednHiker/context-webclient) The database for the data layer is hosted on mLab.
